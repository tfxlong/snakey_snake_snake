# Snakey Snake Snake
---
*Snakey Snake Snake is a version of the popular "Snake" game*

## Rules
---

The objective is to use the keyboard keys to move the snake around the game screen, so that the snake moves over the "frogs" (the white background frog images) and avoid the "toads" (the yellow-filter-applied frog images). Points are accumulated for each eaten frog, and the game ends if a toad is eaten. As more frogs are eaten, the game speed increases, as does the length of the snake. 

In this version, there can be one or two players, and there are two difficulty levels: "Beginner" and "Expert".  

* In Beginner difficulty, there are no outer boundaries - snakes will move from one side of the screen and transport to the other side. The starting game speed is also slower.  
* In Expert mode, snakes cannot run into the outer boundaries, and the initial game speed is faster.  

In 2-Player mode, points are awarded to the other player for errors. For instance, if Player 1 runs into Player 2 (except for a "headbutt"), or Player 1 eats a Toad, then points are awarded to Player 2.  

Keys for game play are as follows:

* ESC to exit
* ENTER to proceed  
* Arrow Keys **UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** to direct the Player 1 snake
* Keys &nbsp; **w s a d** &nbsp;  to direct the Player 2 snake, corresponding with directions up, down, left, right  

High Scores are retained for the running of the game, but not when the game is exited.  

*While some conditions exist to help prevent the snake from moving too far outside of the boundaries of the Game Screen, it is encouraged to maintain the same direction of travel when transporting from one side of the screen to the other. For instance, if moving in a downwards direction, do not try to move left/right when transporting. In order to maintain the visual aspect, there are occasions when a snake can 'disappear' off the game screen. If this occurs, the game can be exited and restarted :)*

## Running the Game
---
Once files are downloaded, the game can be run by navigating to the game file directory, and running the main.py file.  
For instance, using the terminal command 
```Python
python main.py
```  

It is anticipated that this method will be improved in due course
